# Hawktimus Prime Robotics
## Overview
Hawktimus Prime is FRC Team 3229, from Holly Springs NC. We are a 501(c)(3) Non-Profit organization that operates inside Holly Springs High School. This is the GitHub Organization for our team, where we store all of our code and libraries.
## Yearly-Repos
Each year we open source the years code used on the robot, under its specific years repository. For example, the code for the 2023-24 Crescendo Season, our code can be found under [Hawktimus23-34](https://github.com/Team3229/Hawktimus23-24). We will make a new release for each competition we go to each season for ease of access.
## Open-Source Libraries
We have released a number of (Mostly intact) Open-Source Libraries. These can all be found under the [Hawk-Libraries](https://github.com/Team3229/Hawk-Libraries) Repository. We are actively working on (some of) these, and will try to keep important ones (Such as the Swerve Drivebase) up to date with the latest WPI Versions. If there is anything you would like updated/changed, feel free to make an issue or PR if you would like to try fixing it!
